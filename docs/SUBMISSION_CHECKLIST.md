Subject: AutoConnect v1.3 wagmi State Sync Issue

Hi AutoConnect Team,

I've successfully integrated AutoConnect v1.3 into our SporkDAO app, but discovered
a critical issue: wagmi/RainbowKit don't recognize the connection after AutoConnect
succeeds.

TL;DR:
- Thirdweb connects successfully ‚úÖ
- wagmi hooks return disconnected ‚ùå
- Required manual wagmi state.setState() workaround

I've documented:
1. The problem and root cause
2. Why standard approaches (connectAsync, reconnect) don't work
3. Our working workaround
4. Proposed fixes for the package

See attached:
- GitHub issue (ready to post): docs/GITHUB_ISSUE_AUTOCONNECT.md
- Full report: docs/AUTOCONNECT_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md
- Code changes: docs/CHANGES_FOR_AUTOCONNECT_TEAM.md

The fix would enable true "zero-code integration" as promised by v1.3.

Happy to discuss or provide more details!

## üéØ Recommended Fix Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY**: Automatic wagmi sync in `UnicornAutoConnect` component

This would:
- ‚úÖ Enable zero-code integration (v1.3 goal)
- ‚úÖ Work with RainbowKit automatically
- ‚úÖ No developer workarounds needed

**Implementation**: Add wagmi state sync in the `onConnect` handler of `UnicornAutoConnect.jsx`

See `docs/CHANGES_FOR_AUTOCONNECT_TEAM.md` for complete code example.

## ‚úÖ What We Achieved

Despite the issue, we got it working:

1. ‚úÖ AutoConnect detects URL parameters
2. ‚úÖ Thirdweb wallet connects
3. ‚úÖ wagmi hooks recognize connection (via workaround)
4. ‚úÖ RainbowKit shows connected state
5. ‚úÖ Ready for transaction testing

**The workaround works, but should be built into the package.**
